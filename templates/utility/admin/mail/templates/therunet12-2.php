How many Internet users are there in Russia? How big are the Russian Internet advertising and eCommerce markets? Today, when Russian giants such as Yandex and Mail.ru Group are among the largest companies in Europe, we see a great interest in Russian Internet business in the West, but we also see a great shortage of information on the subject. That is why weâ€™ve created first semi-annual short report titled The Runet 2012 with the help of our colleagues from Russian Association for Electronic Communications and Interactive Advertising Bureau. This report covers such topics as Russian internet industry international milestones, Runet in numbers and facts, top advertisers, eCommerce and ePayments.

The Runet 2012 is a free download available at http://therunet.com/en/2012/

TheRunet is a blog dedicated to news and analysis on the Russian Internet Industry. Every day, we will bring you news on Russian companies, current research data and commentary from the leading experts.

Our aim at TheRunet is to introduce international readers to most recent developments in the Russian-speaking sector of the Internet, with its rapidly growing markets, innovative startups, major deals and more Russian players entering European, American and Asian web markets.
